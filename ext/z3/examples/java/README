### This is work-in-progress and does not work yet.

Small example using the Z3 Java bindings.
To build the example execute
   make examples
in the build directory.

It will create JavaExample.class in the build directory,
which can be run on Windows via 
   java -cp com.microsoft.z3.jar;. JavaExample

On Linux and FreeBSD, we must use
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. java -cp com.microsoft.z3.jar:. JavaExample
