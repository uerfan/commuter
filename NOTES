Needless commutativity:
  stat -> projections of return values
  unordered pipe -> state divergence on write
  unmap -> need an application?

Our current system calls are non-blocking.  Blocking pipe read may be
slightly more commutative.  Perhaps the right way to represent blocking is
to raise PreconditionFailure: e.g., a blocking pipe read would not have
returned so early in a normal execution.  We can then reason separately
about blocking and non-blocking pipe reads.

close*close test cases: two close's of a pipe writer end don't scale on
xv6, but we don't generate this test case because our path condition
does not involve Fd.ispipe, and Z3's model gives testgen a "false"
via default interpretation.
